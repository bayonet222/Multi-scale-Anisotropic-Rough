## **Multi-scale Anisotropic Rough Surface** (MARS) Algorithm 

Thomas O. Jelly / 2018.

This package provides a Multi-scale Anisotropic Rough Surface algorithm for numerical generation of rough surfaces with specified statistical parameters. It comes with both CLI and GUI.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

The algorithm has been written to work only with Python 2. It was developed in Python 2.7.15 environment but any 2.7.X version should work correctly. Packages used in the project have been listed in ```requirement.txt``` Running 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
should automatically fetch and install all the necesseray packages.
