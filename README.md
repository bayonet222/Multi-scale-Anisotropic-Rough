**How to install MARS**

Clone the repo by issuing the command
```
foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/tj16x/mars_algorithm
```
and then change directory 
```
foo@bar:~$ cd mars_algorithm
```

***

**How to use MARS**

First, ensure that the python modules "numpy" and "scipy" are installed on your local machine. A quick and easy way to do this is to use the "pip" python package manager. First, install pip by issuing the command
```
foo@bar:~$ sudo apt-get install python-pip 
```
Next, install the numpy and scipy modules by issuing the command 
```
foo@bar:~$ sudo pip install numpy scipy
```
***

**Minimal Working Example**

To run MARS, issue the following command 
```
foo@bar:~$ python main.py
```
